## About the Internship
This internship was undertaken at Oasis Infobyte, where I had the opportunity to work on diverse projects related to machine learning and data analysis with Python. During the internship, I gained hands-on experience and contributed to real-world projects.

## Tasks

- **Task 1: Iris Flower Classification**
  - Classified Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on their measurements using a trained machine learning model.

- **Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python**
  - Analyzed the unemployment rate, particularly during Covid-19, by processing and visualizing relevant data with Python. Explored trends, patterns, and potential insights from the unemployment rate data.

- **Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning**
  - Developed a machine learning model to predict car prices using various factors such as brand goodwill, car features, horsepower, and mileage. Explored the exciting field of car price prediction with machine learning techniques.

- **Task 4: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning**
  - Built an email spam detector using Python and applied machine learning techniques to train the model to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam categories.

- **Task 5: Sales Prediction using Python**
  - Predicted future product sales using Python and machine learning. Explored how different factors, like advertising costs and target segments, influenced sales predictions for a product or service-based business.
